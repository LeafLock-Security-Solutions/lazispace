# lazispace
> A lightweight, cross-platform CLI tool for managing and automating local development environments.

---

## The Problem
Developers often struggle with managing multi-project development environments where they need to run several processes simultaneously. This could be a separate frontend and backend, a monorepo with multiple apps, or any complex project. Opening everything in an IDE is resource-intensive, and manually running terminals is tedious.

`lazispace` solves this by providing a simple, declarative way to define and launch your entire workspace from a single command.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform:** A single native binary for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Declarative Workspaces:** Define your entire multi-service environment in a single JSON file.
- **Rich TUI:** An interactive terminal dashboard to manage all your processes from one place.
- **Highly Customizable:** Configure shells, startup commands, and pane layouts for each service.
